# First React Application - Interacting with Spotify API and React useState(), useEffect()

This is my first React application that was inspired by Codecademy.com React course capstone.

## Functionality

Provides the ability to login to Spotify after a redirect. Once logged in, it gives the ability to search Spotify songs and add specific songs to a playlist array. Once songs selected are desired for the playlist, you can submit a playlist based on a name and the array of songs that were selected.

## Future Improvements

If I were to come back and work on this project, I would dramatically improve the UI experience. Additionally, I would like to refactor my modules into classes. I think there's quite a bit of code that doesn't follow DRY. So it could definitely use more work there.

## Lessons Learned

After creating my first app, I found that variable naming is key and found myself confused with some of the variables that I created.
